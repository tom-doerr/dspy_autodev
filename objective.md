# Objective

This project aims to build a robust, autonomous error-fixing system that can run any Python program (e.g., autodev.py) without modifying its core files. Instead, the system intelligently analyzes runtime errors—such as missing modules, undefined functions, or other common issues—and dynamically generates the required code to resolve them. By capturing error messages, generating fix instructions with an LLM model, and applying fixes through auxiliary components, the system can iteratively achieve a stable execution state.

The approach is designed to be generic and safe: it leverages the current working directory for context, ensuring that file operations are relative to the execution environment ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory), [current.workingdirectory.net](https://current.workingdirectory.net/cwd/), [www.wikiwand.com](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Working_directory)). It also emphasizes best practices for error handling and code modification by automatically generating missing modules and stubs without altering the primary program files ([www.computerhope.com](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/currentd.htm), [www.geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-directory-of-current-python-script/)).

Additional insights were gathered from a recent web search ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example) on examples, [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) for general context, and [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place) for in-place algorithm principles) to inform the design and implementation strategies of the system.
