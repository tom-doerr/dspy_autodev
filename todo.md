# Remove KeyboardInterrupt expectation in main loop integration test.
## details
Update test in `tests/test_main_loop_integration.py` to not expect a `KeyboardInterrupt` since the main loop no longer raises it.
  
# Refine regex assertions in fix module tests.
## details
Adjust regex patterns in `dspy-pipeline/tests/test_fix_module.py` to account for potential variations in whitespace and formatting.

# Ensure LM (Language Model) configuration is executed early.
## details
Verify that `dspy.configure()` is called before any component (like the fix instruction generator) requires the LM.

# Revisit the fix applier logic.
## details
Add logging around file content modifications to determine why expected replacements are not occurring.

# Review test expectations and update tests accordingly.
## details
Ensure that all test cases match the latest system behavior and remove outdated expectations (e.g., expecting exceptions that are no longer raised).
