# Notes

- The pipeline is configured to run `autodev.py` using `run.sh`.
- If `autodev.py` execution results in an error, the pipeline gathers the following inputs:
  - The complete source code of `autodev.py` (marked by "autodev.py:" in the code contents).
  - The error message and traceback from the failed execution.
- These inputs are then passed into the DSPy fix instructions generator via the `get_fix_instructions()` function.
- This behavior ensures that fixes are generated based on both the error details and the source code context.
