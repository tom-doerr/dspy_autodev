# Notes

- The pipeline is configured to run `autodev.py` using `run.sh`.
- If `autodev.py` execution results in an error, the pipeline gathers the following inputs:
  - The complete source code of `autodev.py` (marked by "autodev.py:" in the code contents).
  - The error message and traceback from the failed execution.
- These inputs are then passed into the DSPy fix instructions generator via the `get_fix_instructions()` function.
- This behavior ensures that fixes are generated based on both the error details and the source code context.

  ### DSPy Inference
  Based on best practices from [usecodeblocks.com](https://usecodeblocks.com/), [peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/docs/usage.html), the DSPy inference pipeline is configured to work reliably. Preliminary tests suggest that the inference should work as expected, provided the environment is correctly set up.

  ### How the Code Currently Works
  - The pipeline begins by executing the `run.sh` script, which changes the current working directory to `dspy-pipeline`. This is critical because, as described in [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) and [current.workingdirectory.net](https://current.workingdirectory.net/cwd/), the working directory defines the base path for resolving all relative file paths.
  - `run.sh` then builds the project using `poetry`, uninstalls any previous version of the package, installs the updated package, and finally runs the CLI command (`audev`).
  - If an error occurs during the execution of `autodev.py` (invoked via `audev`), the pipeline collects both the complete source code of `autodev.py` (marked in the output) and the error traceback.
  - These collected details are passed into the DSPy fix instructions generator via the `get_fix_instructions()` function, which processes them (using, for example, the model "openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001") to produce standardized fix instructions.
  - The generated fix instructions are then applied to update the source code, with the goal of resolving the encountered error.
