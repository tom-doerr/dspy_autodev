# Notes

- The pipeline is configured to run `autodev.py` using `run.sh`.
- If `autodev.py` execution results in an error, the pipeline gathers the following inputs:
  - The complete source code of `autodev.py` (marked by "autodev.py:" in the code contents).
  - The error message and traceback from the failed execution.
- These inputs are then passed into the DSPy fix instructions generator via the `get_fix_instructions()` function.
- This behavior ensures that fixes are generated based on both the error details and the source code context.

  ### DSPy Inference
  Based on best practices from [usecodeblocks.com](https://usecodeblocks.com/), [peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/docs/usage.html), the DSPy inference pipeline is configured to work reliably. Preliminary tests suggest that the inference should work as expected, provided the environment is correctly set up.
